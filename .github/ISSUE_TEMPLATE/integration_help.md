We cannot accept integration questions in our issue tracker. 

Uppy is a huge project backed by a small company (Transloadit). We are happy to provide pointers and help with bugs & feature requests but for deeper integration help (making things work on your platform, that already work for the larger community) please refer to our our [community forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy). Uppy developers and aficionados will assist you where they can. The solutions provided, may benefit others onboarding in the future, which making this a sustainable support option for us to provide.

For [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/), commercial support packages are available starting at $1249/mo. This will get you access to Uppy core developers and we'll even help you 

- self-host the server components like Companion, 
- debug bundler issues,

and provide timely responses to other integration questions.
