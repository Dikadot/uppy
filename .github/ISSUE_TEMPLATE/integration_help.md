Transloadit has always been happy to answer any question on GitHub in great depth and detail, but Uppy has now reached a scale where providing free Integration Help (making things work in your situation, that already work for Transloadit and the community at large) is spreading our Uppy team thin. This slows down development and without also making money to hire as the demand goes up, puts the team at risk of burn-out.

As a result, we ask that you use GitHub for bugs & feature requests only, and opt for one of the following, more sustainable ways, to get Integration Help:

**Free Integration Help**. We welcome you on our [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy), where Uppy developers along with aficionados assist you where and when they can. Response times are often good, but don't come with guarantees. The conversations are public and may benefit others in the future. Keep in mind that, especially when you are opting to self-host server components, that we can't go out of our way if you run into problems.

Accepting that you are wandering off supported paths is a valid strategy for many projects. You will only be paying your own team's hours and hosting provider. If however you need assistance or assurance in running server components in a reliable way, you can consider:

- becoming a Transloadit customer. This comes with hosted versions, client-side integration help, and adds encoding capabilities. ($49/mo)
- self-hosting along with with Paid Integration Help ($1499/mo)

**Paid Integration Help**. For deployments where Uppy is critical, [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) can purchase commercial support packages starting at $1499/mo. This will get you 1-on-1 access to Uppy core developers. We can help you self-host server components like Companion, debug bundler issues, support non-current releases, and provide responses to all your integration questions within guaranteed agreed upon response times.
