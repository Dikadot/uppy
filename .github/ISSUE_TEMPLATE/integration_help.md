Uppy is a massive project backed by a small company (Transloadit), and as much as we would like to help each and every non-paying user with their integration questions (making things work in your situation, that already work for the larger community), we would quickly bleed ourselves dry if we were to answer all of them in detail. In order to still get integration help, here are two options for you, that are sustainable for us:

**Free Integration Help**. For integration help for $0, consider asking on our [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy). Here, Uppy developers are supported by aficionados and together they will assist you where and when they can. Typically the response times are good, but this is on a best-effort basis. Keep in mind that, especially when you are choosing to self-host server components, that we can't go out of our way if you run into problems. If you need assistance or assurance in running server components reliably, consider using Transloadit-hosted versions ($49/mo) or self-host along with with Paid Integration Help.

**Paid Integration Help**. For deployments where Uppy is critical, [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) can purchase commercial support packages starting at $1499/mo. This will get you 1-on-1 access to Uppy core developers. We can help you self-host server components like Companion, debug bundler issues, support non-current releases, and provide timely responses to other integration questions.
