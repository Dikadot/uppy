Uppy is a massive project backed by a small company (Transloadit), and how much as we would like to help each single use with their integration question, we would quickly bleed ourselves dry if we were to answer them in detail for our equally massive non-paying userbase. In order to still get integration help, here are two options that are sustainable for us:

**Free Integration Help**. We are happy to provide pointers and help with bugs & feature requests but for deeper integration help (making things work on your platform, that already work for the larger community) please refer to our our [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy). 

Instead, on the forum, Uppy developers are supported by aficionados and together they will assist you where they can. The solutions provided may benefit others in the future. Keep in mind that, especially when you are choosing to self-host server components, that we can't go out of our way if you run into problems. If you need help with the server components you can either use Transloadit-hosted versions ($49/mo) or self-host along with with Paid Integration Help.

**Paid Integration Help**. For deployments where Uppy is critical, [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) can purchase commercial support packages starting at $1499/mo. This will get you 1-on-1 access to Uppy core developers. We can help you self-host server components like Companion, debug bundler issues, support non-current releases, and provide timely responses to other integration questions. The paid route allows us to scale up our support staff, making this a sustainable way of providing integration help, also.
