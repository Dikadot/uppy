Uppy is has grown into a massive project, backed by a small company (Transloadit). As much as we would like to assist each and every non-paying user with integration questions (making things work in your situation, that already work for the larger community), that would grind innovation to a halt and burn out our crew quickly. 

In order to still provide integration help, we're making two options available that are sustainable:

**Free Integration Help**. Your question is welcome on our [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy), where Uppy developers along with aficionados assist you where and when they can. Response times are often good, but don't come with guarantees. The answers may benefit others in the future. Keep in mind that, especially when you are opting to self-host server components, that we can't go out of our way if you run into problems as route simply leads to our company's demise, as well as Uppy's. 

Accepting that you are wandering off supported paths may be a valid strategy for many projects, and you will only be paying your own hours and hosting provider. If however you need assistance or assurance in running server components in a reliable way, you can consider:

- using Transloadit-hosted versions (which also gets you basic Integration Help and adds encoding capabilities) ($49/mo)
- self-hosting along with with Paid Integration Help ($1499/mo)

**Paid Integration Help**. For deployments where Uppy is critical, [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) can purchase commercial support packages starting at $1499/mo. This will get you 1-on-1 access to Uppy core developers. We can help you self-host server components like Companion, debug bundler issues, patch non-current releases, and provide responses to all your integration questions within guaranteed agreed upon response times.
