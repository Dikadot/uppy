name: Integration help
about: Do you need assistance with building the Uppy client in your bundler, or running Companion on your own preferred server platform?
labels: Not Accepted

As much as we'd love to provide detailed integration help (making things work for you, that already work for the community at large) to each non-paying user, Uppy has now reached a scale where this is no longer feasible for our small company. We'd spread our Uppy devs thin, grinding innovation to a halt, and with no money for this coming in, we can't hire our way out of it.

Thinking how we could offer help to developers and enterprises in a sustainable way, we ask that you pick one of three options:

### ðŸ¦„ Community Support

Uppy developers and aficionados alike monitor the [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy) and assist where they can. Response times don't come with guarantees. The conversations are public and can benefit others in the future. 

When you are opting to self-host server components, accept that you are wandering off supported paths and that we can't go out of our way fix a problem on your platform. Self-hosting maybe still be a valid strategy for many projects however. We have docs & tests and you will not be paying us anything (**$0/mo**). You might be paying your team's hours and hosting provider however.

â†¬ All integration questions from non-paying users are welcome via the [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy).

### ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Support

All existing and new [Transloadit Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) enjoy hosted versions of Uppy's Companion and Tus, as well as a wide array of encoding features (10GB of credit included), and an hour of basic client-side integration help. Starting at **$49/mo**. 

â†¬ Client-side integration questions from paying users are welcome via [Transloadit Support](https://transloadit.com/support/) (please announce your account's email address).

### ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Support

For deployments where Uppy is critical, [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) can purchase commercial support packages starting at **$1499/mo**. This will get you 1-on-1 access to Uppy core developers. We can debug bundler issues, support non-current releases, investigate bugs, and will operate within guaranteed response times (depending on package). Purchasing encoding volume is optional, as with these packages we will even help you self-host server components.

â†¬ All integration questions from enterprises are welcome via [Transloadit Support](https://transloadit.com/support/) (please announce your account's email address).
