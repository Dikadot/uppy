name: Integration help
about: Do you need assistance with building the Uppy client in your bundler, or running Companion on your own preferred server platform?
labels: Not Accepted
---

As much as we'd like to provide detailed integration help (making things work for you, that already work for the larger community) to each non-paying user, Uppy has now reached a point where this is no longer feasible for our small company. We'd spread our developers thin, grinding innovation to a halt, and with no money for this coming in, we can't hire our way out of it.

In order to offer assistance to developers, businesses, and enterprises in a sustainable way, we present you with three options:

### ðŸ¦„ Community Support

Uppy developers and aficionados assist where they can on the [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy). No guaranteed response times but we do our best! The conversations are public and indexed by search engines so they can benefit others in the future. 

Running Companion on a server is required for the Instagram, Dropbox, etc. integrations. Running a tusd server is required to enable resumable file uploads.

The Uppy client still works great without these components, but if you are opting to self-host them, keep in mind that we can't go out of our way fix a problem. But: you will not be paying us anything (**$0/mo**) (hosting & team costs may apply)

â†¬ We encourage all users to try our [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy).

### ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Support

All paying [Transloadit Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) on all plans enjoy:
 
 - hosted versions of Uppy's Companion and Tusd
 - as a wide array of encoding features (10GB of credit included)
 - assistence with your Transloadit integration (wether Uppy, or a different client)
 
There is no need to purchase support packages. Plans start at **$49/mo**. 

â†¬ If the Community Forum wasn't helpful, client-side integration questions from paying users are welcome via [Transloadit Support](https://transloadit.com/support/) (please announce your account's email address).

### ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Support

For deployments where Uppy is critical, [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) can purchase commercial support packages starting at **$1499/mo**. This will get you 

- 1-on-1 access to Uppy core developers
- debugging bundler issues, bugs, etc
- support for non-current releases
- investigate bugs
- guaranteed response times

It's possible to purchase these package without encoding volume, as with these packages support can even be extended to self-hosting Uppy and Tus server components.

â†¬ All integration questions from enterprises are welcome via [Transloadit Support](https://transloadit.com/support/) (please announce your account's email address).
