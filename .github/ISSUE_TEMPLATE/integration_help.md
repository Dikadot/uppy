Uppy is a massive project backed by a small company (Transloadit), and we would quickly bleed ourselves dry if we were to resolve the integration issues of our non-paying userbase. In order to still provide integration help in a sustainable way, ther are two options:

**Free Support**. We are happy to provide pointers and help with bugs & feature requests but for deeper integration help (making things work on your platform, that already work for the larger community) please refer to our our [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy). 

Especially when you are choosing to self-host server components, keep in mind that we can't go out of our way if you run into problems. We would not gain the resources to hire more people, not have time to innovate, burn ourselves out, etc. Not pretty.

Instead, on the forum, Uppy developers are supported by aficionados and together they will assist you where they can. The solutions provided may benefit others in the future, which makes this a more sustainable way of providing integration help.

**Paid Support**. For deployments where Uppy is critical, [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) can purchase commercial support packages starting at $1499/mo. This will get you access to Uppy core developers. We can help you self-host server components like Companion, debug bundler issues, support non-current releases, and provide timely responses to other integration questions. The paid route allows us to scale up our support department, making this a sustainable way of providing integration help, also.
