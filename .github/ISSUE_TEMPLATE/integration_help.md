We cannot accept integration questions in our issue tracker. 

Uppy is a huge project backed by a small company. We are happy to provide pointers and help with bugs & feature requests but for deeper integration help (trying to get it to work in your own ecosystem) please refer to our our [community forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy). 

For [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) commercial support options are available starting at $1249/mo.
