Transloadit has always been happy to answer any question on GitHub, but Uppy has now reached a scale where providing Integration Help (making things work for you, that already work for Transloadit and the community at large) is spreading our team thin, slowing down development. Since we're not making any money on that time we invest in other people's products, we also can't up our hiring along with the demand, worsening the problem.

We thought about how to cater to the increasing demand in a sustainable way, and now ask that you use GitHub for bugs & feature requests only, and use these ways, to get Integration Help:

**ðŸ¦„ Community Support**. We welcome you on our [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy), where Uppy developers and aficionados assist you where and when they can. Response times are often good, but don't come with guarantees. The conversations are public and may benefit others in the future. 

When you are opting to self-host server components, keep in mind that we can't go out of our way if you run into problems. Accepting that you are wandering off supported paths is a valid strategy for many projects however. We have docs and you will not be paying anything (**$0/mo**) outside of your own team's hours and hosting provider's costs.

â†¬ All integration questions from non-paying users are welcome via [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy).

**ðŸ¥‡ Bronze Support**. All [Transloadit Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) enjoy hosted versions of Uppy's Companion and Tus, as well as a wide array of encoding options (10GB of credit included), and an hour of basic client-side integration help. Starting at **$49/mo**.

â†¬ Basic client side integration questions from paying users are welcome via [Transloadit Support](https://transloadit.com/support/) (announce your account's email address).

**ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Support (and up ðŸ¥‡)**. For deployments where Uppy is critical, [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) can purchase commercial support packages starting at **$1499/mo**. This will get you 1-on-1 access to Uppy core developers. We can debug bundler issues, support non-current releases, investigate bugs on your platform, and provide responses to all your integration questions within guaranteed agreed-upon response times. Purchasing encoding volume is optional, as with these packages we will even help you self-host server components.

â†¬ All integration questions from enterprises are welcome via [Transloadit Support](https://transloadit.com/support/) (announce your account's email address).
