Uppy is has grown into a massive project, still backed by a small company (Transloadit). As much as we would like to assist each and every non-paying user with integration questions (making things work in your situation, that already work for the larger community), that would grind innovation to a halt and burn out our support crew. 

In order to still provide integration help, we're making two options available that are sustainable for us:

**Free Integration Help**. Every question is welcome on our [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy). Here, Uppy developers are supported by aficionados and together they will assist you where and when they can. Response times are often good, but come with no guarantees. Keep in mind that, especially when you are choosing to self-host server components, that we can't go out of our way if you run into problems. It would simply bankrupt our company and destroy Uppy along with it. If you need assistance or assurance in running server components in a reliable way, consider using Transloadit-hosted versions ($49/mo) or self-host along with with Paid Integration Help.

**Paid Integration Help**. For deployments where Uppy is critical, [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) can purchase commercial support packages starting at $1499/mo. This will get you 1-on-1 access to Uppy core developers. We can help you self-host server components like Companion, debug bundler issues, support non-current releases, and provide timely responses to other integration questions.
