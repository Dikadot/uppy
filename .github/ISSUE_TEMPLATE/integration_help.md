name: Integration help
about: Do you need assistance with building the Uppy client in your bundler, or running Companion on your own preferred server platform?
labels: Not Accepted

As much as we'd love to provide detailed integration help (making things work for you, that already work for the larger community) to each non-paying user, Uppy has now reached a scale where this is no longer feasible for our small company. We'd spread our Uppy devs thin, grinding innovation to a halt, and with no money for this aid coming in, we can't hire our way out of it.

We thought about how we could offer assistance to developers and enterprises in a sustainable way, and present you with three options:

### ðŸ¦„ Community Support

Uppy developers and aficionados assist where they can on the [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy). No guaranteed response times but we do our best! The conversations are public and indexed by search engines so they can benefit others in the future. 

When you are opting to self-host server components, keep in mind that

- Uppy still works without any of our server components. They are only needed for fetching from Dropbox, Instagram, etc, and resumable uploads (tus)
- You are wandering off supported paths so we can't go out of our way fix a problem. But, you will not be paying anything (**$0/mo**) except for maybe your team's hours and hosting provider

â†¬ We encourage all users to try our [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy).

### ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Support

All existing and new [Transloadit Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) enjoy hosted versions of Uppy's Companion and Tus, as well as a wide array of encoding features (10GB of credit included), and an hour of basic client-side integration help. Starting at **$49/mo**. 

â†¬ If the Community Forum wasn't helpful, client-side integration questions from paying users are welcome via [Transloadit Support](https://transloadit.com/support/) (please announce your account's email address).

### ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Support

For deployments where Uppy is critical, [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) can purchase commercial support packages starting at **$1499/mo**. This will get you 1-on-1 access to Uppy core developers. We can debug bundler issues, support non-current releases, investigate bugs, and will operate within guaranteed response times. Purchasing encoding volume is optional, as with these packages we will even help you self-host Uppy and Tus server components.

â†¬ All integration questions from enterprises are welcome via [Transloadit Support](https://transloadit.com/support/) (please announce your account's email address).
