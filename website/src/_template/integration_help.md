As much as we'd love to provide detailed integration help (making things work for you, that already work for the larger community) to each non-paying user, Uppy has now reached a scale where this is no longer feasible for our small company. We'd spread our Uppy devs thin, grinding innovation to a halt, and with no money for this aid coming in, we can't hire our way out of it.

We thought about how we could offer assistance to developers and enterprises in a sustainable way, and present you with three options:

### ðŸ¦„ Community Support

Uppy developers and aficionados assist where they can on the [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy). No guaranteed response times but we do our best! The conversations are public and indexed by search engines so they can benefit others in the future. 

Running Companion on a server is required for the Instagram, Dropbox, etc. integrations. Running a tusd server is required to enable resumable file uploads.

The Uppy client still works great without these components, but if you are opting to self-host them, keep in mind that we can't go out of our way fix a problem. But: you will not be paying us anything (**$0/mo**) (hosting & team costs may apply)

â†¬ We encourage all users to try our [Community Forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy).

### ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Support

All existing and new [Transloadit Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) enjoy hosted versions of Uppy's Companion and Tus, as well as a wide array of encoding features (10GB of credit included), and an hour of basic client-side integration help. Starting at **$49/mo**. 

â†¬ If the Community Forum wasn't helpful, client-side integration questions from paying users are welcome via [Transloadit Support](https://transloadit.com/support/) (please announce your account's email address).

### ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Support

For deployments where Uppy is critical, [Transloadit Enterprise Customers](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) can purchase commercial support packages starting at **$1499/mo**. This will get you 1-on-1 access to Uppy core developers. We can debug bundler issues, support non-current releases, investigate bugs, and will operate within guaranteed response times. Purchasing encoding volume is optional, as with these packages we will even help you self-host Uppy and Tus server components.

â†¬ All integration questions from enterprises are welcome via [Transloadit Support](https://transloadit.com/support/) (please announce your account's email address).
